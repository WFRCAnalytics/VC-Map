# MAP-Congestion-Forecast

The WFRC - Congestion Forecast (Factored V/C Ratios) map provides an estimate of potentially congested areas for different future scenarios. The metrics shown on this map are useful for planning and prioritization as comparative measures of travel demand and do not necessarily reflect anticipated conditions at the highest factored V/C ratios.

The app itself resides in the `_webapp` folder.

This map provides an estimate of potentially congested areas for WFRC/MAG 2023 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) scenarios.

The metrics shown on this map are useful for planning and prioritization as comparative measures of travel demand and do not necessarily reflect anticipated conditions at the highest factored V/C ratios.

The congestion is based on volume-to-capacity ratios using the following components:

- AADT forecasts for scenarios as prepared using output from the Wasatch Front travel demand model,
- Volume calculated for various weekday time-of-day combinations using factors from UDOT continuous count stations and the travel demand model,
- Roadway capacities for each scenario as calculated in the travel demand model.

Additionally, after selecting a roadway segment, there are useful factors and details available by clicking Calculation Details at the bottom of the sidebar.

Version 9.0.1 (April 2024) of the travel demand model was used to prepare the data for this web app. MAG Forecasts shown are currently draft.
