# MAP-Volume-Over-Capacity

The WFRC - Congestion Forecast (Factored V/C Ratios) map provides an estimate of potentially congested areas for different future scenarios. The metrics shown on this map are useful for planning and prioritization as comparative measures of travel demand and do not necessarily reflect anticipated conditions at the highest factored V/C ratios.
